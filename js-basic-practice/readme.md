# JavaScript Utility Project

This project contains a collection of JavaScript utilities and an interactive HTML page to demonstrate their functionality. The utilities include operations like Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, sum calculation, finding the maximum number, reversing strings, vowel counting, grade calculation, and more.

## Features

### HTML Page
The interactive HTML page allows users to:
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- Calculate the sum of numbers.
- Find the maximum number in an array.
- Display even numbers from an array.

- Check grades based on marks.
- Calculate the average of an array.

### JavaScript Utilities
using Dom, i have created this things where i used DOM manipulation like selecting html elements and updating input values and tags inner html, etc

- Temperature conversion.
- Array operations (sum, max, even numbers).
- String manipulation (reverse, vowel count).
- Grade calculation.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file with interactive UI elements.
- **index.js**: JavaScript file handling DOM interactions.
- **tasks.js**: Contains reusable utility functions.
- **assets/**: Directory for additional resources (e.g., images, videos).
